# 🌐 Web Browser in C++ 🚀

Welcome to my **Web Browser** project! This is a lightweight, fun, and functional browser built from scratch in C++. It’s designed to showcase my skills in systems programming, GUI development, and working with modern web technologies. Whether you're a recruiter, fellow developer, or just curious, I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed building it! 😊

## 🎯 Features

- **Tab Management**:
  - 🆕 **F2**: Create a new tab
  - ❌ **F3**: Delete the current tab
  - 🔄 **F6**: Duplicate the current tab

- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with performance in mind using **WebKit** and **GTK**.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to work on Linux systems (with potential for expansion to other platforms).

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **low-level systems programming** in C++.
- Integrate **modern web technologies** (WebKit) into a native application.
- Design and implement a **user-friendly GUI** using GTK.
- Manage **complex dependencies** and build systems.

It’s a testament to my passion for building practical, efficient, and elegant software solutions. 💻✨
